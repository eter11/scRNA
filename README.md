Analysis of scRNA data set
human1 fetches the document from the file directory. My file is in C:\ASHIM\scRNA\Humna1\human1.csv, you may change the directory according to your data location.
I am duplicating the copy of the data so that I dont have to read the file again and again.
After creating the matrix we are ready for analysis of scRNA data set.

My codes are written in R using RStudio, so you might want to install R from the following platform:
for R engine: https://cran.r-project.org/    (according to your environment)
